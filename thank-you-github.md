#Thank You GitHub

And all other OSS community leaders.

Because of you, a dramatic shift is taking place where **altruistic, volunteer contributions are the most important items on a resume in the community of computer programming**. 

I say community, not field, because despite the relatively introverted nature of the average programmer, to me this field has always felt like a community. It seems while residents from other "9-5" professions conglomerate via water cooler talks, union meetings, weekend BBQs and pub nights, programmers have always had a secret, nerd-only method of communicating with each other from anywhere in the world - in real-time, without bias, for a simple membership fee of $[your internet bill]/month.

The Internet has of course always been a public venue. But most of the jobs in the programming market are based around creating, supporting and maintaining the cogs that keep the unimaginably complex WWW machine churning. So naturally we've had a pretty big head-start to set up some comfy e-lounging areas to sit around and share information.  Which ironically has led to BBQs, pub nights and other physical gatherings that would otherwise not have been possible[1].

When's the last time your plumber or lawyer invited you & some other clients out for free drinks to get feedback on their service?*

Last week I was talking to a web designer colleague and [StackOverflow](www.stackoverflow.com) came up. When I asked if he uses the site he said he had actually posted a question the other day for the first time. Within minutes he had people competing with each other to make sure he had the best solution possible. He couldn't believe the quality and promptness of the answers.

Just think about that for a minute. 

Now imagine you're an accountant sitting in your cubicle and you have a question about how to handle a particular expense reported by your client. You really don't want to mess it up because it will look poorly on you and your company.

You could ask a neighbour or maybe walk down the hall and find "that guy" who always knows the answer (if he isn't busy). But what if you could take a minute to post your question with a free service and have thousands of other accountants view it within seconds to offer their opinions of the correct way to handle the situation. Further to that, a strict set of rules are in place preventing said accountants from criticizing your query or being otherwise belligerent. 

On that note, how nice would it be as a construction worker to be able to ask his foreman (or any other foreman) a question without having to be laughingly cursed at or regaled with stories of how back in his day things were so much harder?

As software developers, we ask lots of questions.  Everyday. 

As an accountant or construction worker you may not understand how this system sustains itself. Why are these other people, many of whom are veterans, volunteering their time to answer my question in such a professional, helpful manner? They aren't being paid and will likely never meet you.

The answer is that they are being paid, except it's a new form of altruistic currency known as [reputation capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_capital). While the concept is nothing new, the widespread acceptance of it in the industry is.

Almost all top employers in the area of web development now require a [GitHub](http://www.github.com) profile displaying your OSS contributions to accompany a resume and other community contributions are highly regarded.

> **We don't care what you got paid to do, we care what you did for free because you wanted to.**

The small, point-form *volunteered at...* section of our resumes is moving from the bottom of the last page onto its own cover sheet to be proudly and descriptively displayed.

This mentality has produced an enormous string of benefits, of which I don't believe enough programmers are taking advantage of. As a programmer, active participation in this system can drastically improve both your professional and personal lives.

##Free, High Quality Tools

Everyday a [flood of new projects are neatly placed on the free, open market](https://github.com/search?q=created%3A%22%3E2013-07-09+%3C%3D2013-07-10%22&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults).  This wonderful market doesn't require a plane ticket, passport, a job, car, or even a driver's licence.  There are no age restrictions, gender, race, or religious biases. You aren't required to physically be  able to walk, or even to [hear or see](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria) (if we do our jobs properly).

Really busy? No problem. You don't have to go to this market and look around to see what's new or if something you already use has been upgraded. The venue will personally notify you so you can browse at your liesure.

Does a tool you found not quite fit your needs?  Conveniently, the instructions on how to customize it are also supplied - generally in many different ways so you can find a DIY implementation plan that you're most comfortable with.

How nice would it be as a landscaper to know that masses of people who are well versed in your struggles are trying every possible solution for improving your daily grind?  Any ordinary non-billionaire with a great idea can act on it immediately and at no tangible cost.

##Diversity is Good

People love to bash other languages, technologies, or ideas that they aren't comfortable with. For programming languages, I often read comments or hear colleagues harp on missing or poorly designed features.  In my experience there tends to be other features of the language that a user enjoys (syntax & style are a big one) and don't require Feature X to be perfect. 

Stop doing that please. It's great to be able to choose whatever tools you prefer, and we have a huge selection!  And don't tell me it's too confusing having so many options, that's like saying you have too much money to count. 

Besides, we're engineers. We signed up for complexity.

##TL;DR

Working in computer science is awesome, I feel lucky to be involved in it. Participate in OSS and in free resource communities. You will make more money and enjoy your job :)
